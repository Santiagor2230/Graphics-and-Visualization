# How do I approach designing software?

## What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?

I have learned alot of things desgining through openGL, I never though I will learn to craft 2 dimensional and 3 dimensional structures with its own lighting and ofcourse manipulation of these objects. I learned alot about how to build primitive objects and set their own position, camera view, projection and rotation. 

## What design process did you follow for your project work?

The desgin process that I follow in my projects in order to achieve the desgining of the software will be to plan the correct manner in which my scene should be develop, what type of primitive shapes are needed to make the scene similar to the pictures we took of realistic objects and understanding the position of these objects and the camera itself, planning on building similar lighting scene in my openGL to the pictures we took in order to make it more realistic.

## How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

The tactics in software desgining that I have used here that can be used for future work are basically the improvements in my analyses and planing of the software before I implemented into code which helps me to effeciently build my software better each time and I think having this tactics in mind can help me in future work.

# How do I approach developing programs?
## What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?

The new development strategies that I use while working on the 3D scene will be to utilize planning which will help me plan correctly what types of scene I should use with camera, lighting, shapes and textures, then I desgin the structure of how I want to deelop the scene and then later I will implement the structure to make the 3D scene.

## How did iteration factor into your development?

iteration had a big role in my development because it allows me to make the scene run contiounsly as well as the inputs that are neccesary for either the objects or the camera to move around the scene was made possible with the help of iteration.

## How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

my approach of developing code evolve throughout the milestone because I started to plan out better what I wanted to do when building the projects such as understanding what primitive shapes I should use, how I should apply lightin on the scene and what position of both the camera and the object should be in the scene.

# How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
## How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?

computational graphics and visualizations will allow me to learn how to use other APIs such as vulkan which is similar to OpenGL but better in some ways as well as allow me to learn more about softwares such as unity and unreal engine 5 which after learning how computate through openGL made it easier to understand these softwares in depth.

## How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

computational graphics and visualization will allow me to make visualization computation in machine learning projects that might allow to build something similar to AI PLAYGROUND which is part of NVIDIA new A.I that draws upon images that others might do in a simpler way such things can be done in future profesional projects that I might develop.
