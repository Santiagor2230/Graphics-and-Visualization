# How do I approach designing software?

## What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?

I have learned alot of things desgining through openGL, I never though I will learn to craft 2 dimensional and 3 dimensional structures with its own lighting and ofcourse manipulation of these objects. I learned alot about how to build primitive objects and set their own position, camera view, projection and rotation. 

## What design process did you follow for your project work?

The desgin process that I follow in my projects in order to achieve the desgining of the software will be to plan the correct manner in which my scene should be develop, what type of primitive shapes are needed to make the scene similar to the pictures we took of realistic objects and understanding the position of these objects and the camera itself, planning on building similar lighting scene in my openGL to the pictures we took in order to make it more realistic.

## How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

# How do I approach developing programs?


I approach developing program in my projects while using opengl will be the proper steps that are needed to build a scene which will be to understand the shaders, to follow on how to build upong primitive objects, setting up the scene with the camera position, projection and rotation similar to the objects positioning and finalyl we send this information to the GPU in order for the visualization to be render.

## What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?

The new development strategies that I use while working on the 3D scene will be to utilize planning which will help plan correctly understand what type of primitive shapes I am going to work, understanding what type of lighting I need to use, making sure 

## How did iteration factor into your development?

## How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
