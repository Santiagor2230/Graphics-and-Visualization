# How do I approach designing software?

## What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?

I have learned alot of things desgining through openGL, I never though I will learn to craft 2 dimensional and 3 dimensional structures with its own lighting and ofcourse manipulation of these objects. I learned alot about how to build primitive objects and set their own position, camera view, projection and rotation. 

## What design process did you follow for your project work?

The desgin process that I follow in my projects while using opengl will be the proper steps that are needed to build a scene and I am mostly 

## How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

# How do I approach developing programs?
## What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?

## How did iteration factor into your development?

## How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

# How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
